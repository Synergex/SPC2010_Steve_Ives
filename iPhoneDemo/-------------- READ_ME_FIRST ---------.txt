
This may LOOK like a Visual Studio solution file, but it isn't!!!

To open this solution you need to use MonoDevelop on an Intel-based Apple Mac,
and the system needs to also have all the Apple developer tools and SDK's and
also the MonoTouch product from Novell (eval version should be OK).

Don't try to open this in Visual Studio - it won't work!!!
